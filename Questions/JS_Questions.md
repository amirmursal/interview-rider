Hereâ€™s your roadmap ðŸ‘‡

1. Sliding Window  
   = When you need to find subarrays or substrings in a linear DS (like arrays or strings) that meet a certain condition  
   \_ Used in problems like: longest subarray, max sum of k-length window, etc.

2. Two Pointers  
   = For sorted arrays/strings where you move 2 pointers to meet a condition  
   \_ Used in: pair sums, palindrome checks, merging sorted arrays

3. Modified Binary Search  
   = Classic binary search but adapted for rotated arrays, infinite search space, or conditions beyond equality  
   \_ Used in: search in rotated array, peak element, kth element in sorted matrix

4. Subset/Backtracking  
   = When you need to generate all combinations or permutations  
   \_ Used in: subsets, combinations, permutations, N-Queens

5. Top-K Elements  
   = When you need to find the k smallest/largest items efficiently  
   \_ Always think heaps/priority queues here

6. DFS/BFS on Trees  
   = To explore all nodes in a treeâ€”depth-first (recursion) or level-by-level (queues)  
   \_ Used in: max depth, level order traversal, path sums

7. Topological Sort  
   = Used in Directed Acyclic Graphs when there's dependency (prerequisite) between nodes  
   \_ Common in: course scheduling, task ordering

8. Dynamic Programming  
   = The final boss. For overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure  
   \_ Used in: knapsack, DP on strings, grid paths, longest subsequences
