# Coding Challenges

1. **Implementing Dark Mode in a React Application**

   - Learn how to add dark mode functionality to your React application using themes and context.
   - Example: Using local storage to persist the user's theme preference across sessions.

2. **Fetching and Rendering Data or Large Images**

   - Challenge: Fetch data from any free API (e.g., Unsplash) and render large images or dynamic data on the screen.
   - Focus: Use efficient rendering techniques and handling asynchronous data fetching with React.

3. **Counter App with Start, Pause, and Reverse**

   - Build a counter app in React with three buttons: Start, Pause, and Reverse.
   - Aim: Understand how to manage component state and handle time-based actions.

4. **Transaction Sync with Polling**

   - Scenario: A transaction is initiated, but the bank's confirmation comes later via a separate API call.
   - Discussion: Implement a polling strategy in React to keep the frontend synced with the transaction status. Handle failure and success updates dynamically.
   - Follow-up: Alternative methods for handling real-time updates, such as WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

5. **Search Bar with API Integration**

   - Implement a search bar in React that fetches suggestions or search results from an API.
   - Goal: Optimize API calls to avoid excessive requests while ensuring smooth UX.

6. **CSS Positioning Challenge**

   - Explore complex real-world scenarios involving CSS positioning.
   - Focus: Handling edge cases with absolute, relative, fixed, and sticky positioning in layouts.

7. **Browser History Feature Implementation**

   - Implement a browser history feature in React that allows navigating back and forward by a specified number of steps.
   - Key concepts: `history` object, `pushState`, `goBack`, `goForward`, and managing session history effectively.

PayPal interview experience (35-45 LPA range)

1st ROUND - Domain-specific round
ðŸ“Œ Difference between DOM and BOM, and Es6 feature
ðŸ“Œ What is web accessible and some follow-up questions
ðŸ“Œ Implement a typeahead with a feature list that should populate using the search keyword, and the delete icon should wipe out the input field value.

ðŸ‘‰ Gave two approaches and used the normal Array.includes for searching.

2nd ROUND - DSA
ðŸ“Œ Anagram similar to this problem â†’ https://lnkd.in/d6KxUtEK
ðŸ“Œ Array.sort() â†’ Got stuck in the recursion part of quick sort and FAILEDðŸ’”

Hereâ€™s your roadmap ðŸ‘‡

1. Sliding Window  
   = When you need to find subarrays or substrings in a linear DS (like arrays or strings) that meet a certain condition  
   \_ Used in problems like: longest subarray, max sum of k-length window, etc.

2. Two Pointers  
   = For sorted arrays/strings where you move 2 pointers to meet a condition  
   \_ Used in: pair sums, palindrome checks, merging sorted arrays

3. Modified Binary Search  
   = Classic binary search but adapted for rotated arrays, infinite search space, or conditions beyond equality  
   \_ Used in: search in rotated array, peak element, kth element in sorted matrix

4. Subset/Backtracking  
   = When you need to generate all combinations or permutations  
   \_ Used in: subsets, combinations, permutations, N-Queens

5. Top-K Elements  
   = When you need to find the k smallest/largest items efficiently  
   \_ Always think heaps/priority queues here

6. DFS/BFS on Trees  
   = To explore all nodes in a treeâ€”depth-first (recursion) or level-by-level (queues)  
   \_ Used in: max depth, level order traversal, path sums

7. Topological Sort  
   = Used in Directed Acyclic Graphs when there's dependency (prerequisite) between nodes  
   \_ Common in: course scheduling, task ordering

8. Dynamic Programming  
   = The final boss. For overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure  
   \_ Used in: knapsack, DP on strings, grid paths, longest subsequences
