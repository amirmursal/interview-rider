# Coding Challenges

1. **Implementing Dark Mode in a React Application**

   - Learn how to add dark mode functionality to your React application using themes and context.
   - Example: Using local storage to persist the user's theme preference across sessions.

2. **Fetching and Rendering Data or Large Images**

   - Challenge: Fetch data from any free API (e.g., Unsplash) and render large images or dynamic data on the screen.
   - Focus: Use efficient rendering techniques and handling asynchronous data fetching with React.

3. **Counter App with Start, Pause, and Reverse**

   - Build a counter app in React with three buttons: Start, Pause, and Reverse.
   - Aim: Understand how to manage component state and handle time-based actions.

4. **Transaction Sync with Polling**

   - Scenario: A transaction is initiated, but the bank's confirmation comes later via a separate API call.
   - Discussion: Implement a polling strategy in React to keep the frontend synced with the transaction status. Handle failure and success updates dynamically.
   - Follow-up: Alternative methods for handling real-time updates, such as WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

5. **Search Bar with API Integration**

   - Implement a search bar in React that fetches suggestions or search results from an API.
   - Goal: Optimize API calls to avoid excessive requests while ensuring smooth UX.

6. **CSS Positioning Challenge**

   - Explore complex real-world scenarios involving CSS positioning.
   - Focus: Handling edge cases with absolute, relative, fixed, and sticky positioning in layouts.

7. **Browser History Feature Implementation**

   - Implement a browser history feature in React that allows navigating back and forward by a specified number of steps.
   - Key concepts: `history` object, `pushState`, `goBack`, `goForward`, and managing session history effectively.

PayPal interview experience (35-45 LPA range)

1st ROUND - Domain-specific round
📌 Difference between DOM and BOM, and Es6 feature
📌 What is web accessible and some follow-up questions
📌 Implement a typeahead with a feature list that should populate using the search keyword, and the delete icon should wipe out the input field value.

👉 Gave two approaches and used the normal Array.includes for searching.

2nd ROUND - DSA
📌 Anagram similar to this problem → https://lnkd.in/d6KxUtEK
📌 Array.sort() → Got stuck in the recursion part of quick sort and FAILED💔

Here’s your roadmap 👇

1. Sliding Window  
   = When you need to find subarrays or substrings in a linear DS (like arrays or strings) that meet a certain condition  
   \_ Used in problems like: longest subarray, max sum of k-length window, etc.

2. Two Pointers  
   = For sorted arrays/strings where you move 2 pointers to meet a condition  
   \_ Used in: pair sums, palindrome checks, merging sorted arrays

3. Modified Binary Search  
   = Classic binary search but adapted for rotated arrays, infinite search space, or conditions beyond equality  
   \_ Used in: search in rotated array, peak element, kth element in sorted matrix

4. Subset/Backtracking  
   = When you need to generate all combinations or permutations  
   \_ Used in: subsets, combinations, permutations, N-Queens

5. Top-K Elements  
   = When you need to find the k smallest/largest items efficiently  
   \_ Always think heaps/priority queues here

6. DFS/BFS on Trees  
   = To explore all nodes in a tree—depth-first (recursion) or level-by-level (queues)  
   \_ Used in: max depth, level order traversal, path sums

7. Topological Sort  
   = Used in Directed Acyclic Graphs when there's dependency (prerequisite) between nodes  
   \_ Common in: course scheduling, task ordering

8. Dynamic Programming  
   = The final boss. For overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure  
   \_ Used in: knapsack, DP on strings, grid paths, longest subsequences
