# Coding Challenges

1. **Implementing Dark Mode in a React Application**

   - Learn how to add dark mode functionality to your React application using themes and context.
   - Example: Using local storage to persist the user's theme preference across sessions.

2. **Fetching and Rendering Data or Large Images**

   - Challenge: Fetch data from any free API (e.g., Unsplash) and render large images or dynamic data on the screen.
   - Focus: Use efficient rendering techniques and handling asynchronous data fetching with React.

3. **Counter App with Start, Pause, and Reverse**

   - Build a counter app in React with three buttons: Start, Pause, and Reverse.
   - Aim: Understand how to manage component state and handle time-based actions.

4. **Transaction Sync with Polling**

   - Scenario: A transaction is initiated, but the bank's confirmation comes later via a separate API call.
   - Discussion: Implement a polling strategy in React to keep the frontend synced with the transaction status. Handle failure and success updates dynamically.
   - Follow-up: Alternative methods for handling real-time updates, such as WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

5. **Search Bar with API Integration**

   - Implement a search bar in React that fetches suggestions or search results from an API.
   - Goal: Optimize API calls to avoid excessive requests while ensuring smooth UX.

6. **CSS Positioning Challenge**

   - Focus: Handling edge cases with absolute, relative, fixed, and sticky positioning in layouts.

7. **Browser History Feature Implementation**
   - Implement a browser history feature in React that allows navigating back and forward by a specified number of steps.
   - Key concepts: `history` object, `pushState`, `goBack`, `goForward`, and managing session history effectively.
