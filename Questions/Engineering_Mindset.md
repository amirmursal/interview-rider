# If I type any url in browser, how it will work behind the scenes?

# 1. URL Parsing: The browser parses the URL to extract the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), domain name, and path.

# 2. DNS Resolution: The browser checks the DNS (Domain Name System) to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

# 3. TCP Connection: The browser establishes a TCP connection with the server using the resolved IP address.

# 4. HTTP Request: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the resource specified in the URL.

# 5. Server Processing: The server processes the request, retrieves the requested resource, and prepares an HTTP response.

# 6. HTTP Response: The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser, which includes the requested resource (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).

# 7. Rendering: The browser receives the response, parses the HTML, and renders the webpage. It may also make additional requests for resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

# 8. Display: The browser displays the rendered webpage to the user.

# 9. Closing Connection: The browser may close the TCP connection or keep it open for future requests (HTTP/2 or HTTP/3).

# 10. Caching: The browser may cache the resources for faster access on subsequent visits to the same URL.

# what is asset management in web development?

# Asset management in web development refers to the process of organizing, optimizing, and delivering various resources (assets) used in a web application. These assets can include images, stylesheets (CSS), JavaScript files, fonts, and other media. Effective asset management ensures that these resources are efficiently loaded, reducing page load times and improving overall performance. Key aspects of asset management include:

# 1. **Organization**: Structuring assets in a logical manner, often using folders and naming conventions to make them easy to find and maintain.

🚀 Frontend Performance Optimization Cheatsheet ⚡

Slow websites kill conversions. Every 100ms delay in load time can drop conversions by 7% (Amazon data).

Want to build ultra-fast UIs like Google, Netflix, and Amazon? Here’s a performance playbook you NEED to master! 🔥

🔹 Rendering Strategies:
✔ SSR: SEO (e-commerce, blogs)
✔ CSR: Interactive apps (dashboards)
✔ ISR: Dynamic + static (Next.js)
✔ SSG: Blazing fast (static content)
⏳ Choosing the wrong rendering strategy can add 2-3s to load time!

🔥 CRITICAL RENDERING PATH OPTIMIZATIONS 🔥

💡 How to make your app render FASTER?
🚀 1️⃣ Lazy Loading – Load only what’s needed when needed!
✅ Images – Use loading="lazy" for below-the-fold images.
✅ Components – Use React’s React.lazy() & Suspense.
✅ Routes – Use dynamic import() for route-based code splitting.

🧩 2️⃣ Code Splitting – Stop loading unused JS!
✅ Use Webpack + React.lazy() for splitting bundles.
✅ Analyze bundle size with Webpack Bundle Analyzer.
✅ Split vendors (lodash, moment.js) into separate chunks.

🌊 3️⃣ Hydration Optimization – Faster interaction after SSR!
✅ Use partial hydration instead of blocking full hydration.
✅ Defer hydration for non-critical components
✅ Use React Server Components to improve TTI.

📌 4️⃣ Virtualization – Render only what’s visible!
✅ Use React-Window or React-Virtualized for massive lists.
✅ Prevent excessive DOM nodes to avoid jank.

📑 5️⃣ Pagination vs. Infinite Scroll – Which One?
✅ Pagination = Better for SEO (Google can index pages).
✅ Infinite Scroll = Better for UX, but needs careful memory management.

📷 6️⃣ Image Optimization – Reduce Load by 60%+
✅ Use next-gen formats: WebP, AVIF (smaller, better quality).
✅ Serve responsive images
✅ Implement lazy loading & placeholders (blurhash for a smoother UX).

🔄 7️⃣ Optimize Large File Uploads (Images, Videos)
✅ Use client-side compression before uploading.
✅ Enable chunked uploads for large files (e.g., 100MB+).
✅ Use CDNs for media storage (Cloudinary, S3).

⚡ 8️⃣ Web Workers – Offload Heavy Processing
✅ Move CPU-intensive tasks (image processing) to Web Workers.
✅ Keep UI thread free for smooth interactions.

📊 Why Lighthouse Score Isn’t Everything?
📌 Many focus on hitting 100/100 in Lighthouse, but here’s the truth:
✅ Real-world speed matters more than lab tests.
✅ Look at First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
✅ Use WebPageTest & Chrome DevTools for field data, not just Lighthouse.

🚀 Before vs. After: Lighthouse Score Improvements
📊 Before: LCP = 5.2s | CLS = 0.27 | TTI = 6s
📊 After optimizations: LCP = 1.5s | CLS = 0.02 | TTI = 2.1s

I joined Google after working 2.5 years at Amazon. 6 years into tech, I’ve realized that tech isn’t just about coding—it’s about mindset, adaptability, and strategy.

If you're early in your career, here are 7 things I wish I knew sooner:

1. Your Degree Stops Mattering After Your First Job
   No one cares about your GPA. No one asks where you studied. After your first job, what matters is:
   → What have you built?
   → How well do you solve problems?
   → Can you communicate your ideas?
   The sooner you let go of the "college mindset," the faster you grow.

2. Hard Work ≠ Career Growth
   Working 12-hour days and fixing endless Jira tickets won’t make you a staff engineer. What actually moves the needle?
   → Owning high-impact projects.
   → Understanding business problems, not just code.
   → Making your work visible (document, present, share).

3. Your Network is More Powerful Than Your Résumé
   Some of the best opportunities don’t come from job portals. They come from people who know your work.
   → Make friends with engineers outside your team.
   → Engage in tech communities, even if just online.
   → Don’t just network when you need something—give first.

4. Feedback is a Cheat Code (But Most People Avoid It)
   Most engineers wait for performance reviews. That’s a mistake. The best engineers seek feedback constantly.
   → Ask your manager: “What’s one thing I could do better?”
   → After a PR review, ask: “How would you have approached this?”
   → Feedback feels uncomfortable. Growth always is.

5. Being ‘Busy’ is a Trap
   Tech moves fast, and it's easy to get caught in a cycle of always feeling behind. The trick?
   → Focus on leverage: What’s the one task that makes everything else easier?
   → Ruthlessly prioritize. Not everything is urgent.
   → Productivity is not about doing more. It’s about doing the right things.

6. No One is Going to ‘Discover’ You
   A lot of smart engineers stay invisible because they assume their work will speak for itself. It won’t.
   → Share your knowledge (write blogs, give talks, contribute to open source).
   → Speak up in meetings.
   → If people don’t know your impact, it’s as if it never happened.

7. The Game is Long—Play it Smart
   Your career isn’t won or lost in a single year. The best engineers I know play the long game:
   → Invest in relationships.
   → Prioritize learning over short-term gains.
   → Avoid burnout—pace yourself.
   Tech rewards those who stick around and keep improving. Stay in the game, and success becomes inevitable.
