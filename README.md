## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install `nodemon` globally. This will allow you to run JavaScript programs without manually refreshing the console every time.

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

### To run any program, use the following command

`nodemon <filename>`

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
